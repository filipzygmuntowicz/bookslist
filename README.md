# bookslist

A simple online list of books made with python in flask with some info about them in a table. You can search the list, add your own book, edit any of the books or import a book from google books api.

I am currently in the process of rebuilding the site, the old version was really barebones and didn't even follow REST API principles. 

WORK IN PROGRESS.
